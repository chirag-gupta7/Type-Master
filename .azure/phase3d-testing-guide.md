## üêõ Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Mock User ID

**Problem:** Using `'mock-user-id'` for user stats fetching  
**Impact:** Stats won't persist between sessions  
**Workaround:** Hardcoded for now, will be replaced with auth  
**Fix Timeline:** Phase 4 (Auth implementation)

### Issue 2: Stats Not Persisting

**Problem:** User stats only stored in local state  
**Impact:** Refresh page ‚Üí stats reset to 0  
**Workaround:** Complete 10 lessons in one session for milestone  
**Fix Timeline:** When backend save is implemented

### Issue 3: No Sound Effects

**Problem:** Achievements are silent  
**Impact:** Less immersive experience  
**Workaround:** Visual effects compensate  
**Fix Timeline:** Phase 3E (Polish)
