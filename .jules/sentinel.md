# Sentinel's Journal - Critical Security Learnings

## 2025-05-11 - [Client-side AI Key Exposure]
**Vulnerability:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` was exposed in the frontend and used for direct client-side calls to Google's Gemini API.
**Learning:** Any environment variable prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` in Next.js is bundled into the client-side code and is visible to anyone. Direct API calls from the client also leak the API key in the request URL or headers.
**Prevention:** Sensitive API keys must only be stored on the server (backend). Interaction with third-party AI services should be proxied through the backend, where authentication and rate limiting can be enforced.
