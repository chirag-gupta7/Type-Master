## 2025-05-10 - Batching upserts in logMistakes
**Learning:** Sequential database roundtrips in a loop (O(n)) can be significantly optimized by aggregating data first and using Prisma transactions. Even when a native 'upsertMany' is missing, grouping by key and batching within a transaction reduces latency.
**Action:** Always look for loops containing database calls and consider if they can be aggregated or batched using `$transaction`.
