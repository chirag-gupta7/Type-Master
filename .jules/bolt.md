## 2025-05-22 - [Optimizing N+1 queries in statistics endpoints]
**Learning:** Statistics endpoints that iterate over categories (like game types) to perform multiple database queries per category (e.g., count, max, average) create a significant performance bottleneck (N+1 query problem). This can be optimized using Prisma's `groupBy` and aggregate features (`_count`, `_max`, `_avg`) to fetch all required data in a single database roundtrip.
**Action:** Always check for loops containing database queries in controller logic. Prefer bulk data retrieval and in-memory mapping over sequential per-category queries.

## 2025-05-10 - Batching upserts in logMistakes
**Learning:** Sequential database roundtrips in a loop (O(n)) can be significantly optimized by aggregating data first and using Prisma transactions. Even when a native 'upsertMany' is missing, grouping by key and batching within a transaction reduces latency.
**Action:** Always look for loops containing database calls and consider if they can be aggregated or batched using `$transaction`.

## 2025-05-24 - Parallelizing bulk metric fetching
**Learning:** When refactoring N+1 queries into bulk fetches, use `Promise.all` to execute independent `count`, `aggregate`, and `findMany` queries in parallel. This minimizes the total response time to the duration of the slowest query rather than the sum of all queries.
**Action:** Always wrap independent bulk data retrieval queries in `Promise.all` when optimizing controllers.

## 2025-06-05 - [In-memory derivation from joined datasets]
**Learning:** For endpoints like progress dashboards that fetch a comprehensive dataset (e.g., all lessons with user progress), subsequent queries for historical windows or activity metrics can be completely eliminated. Deriving these in-memory from the initial dataset is faster than additional database roundtrips, provided the base data is already in memory.
**Action:** Always check if a new database query is redundant given existing datasets in the controller's scope. Prioritize in-memory filtering and mapping over sequential lookups.
