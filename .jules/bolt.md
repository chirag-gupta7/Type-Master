## 2025-05-22 - [Optimizing N+1 queries in statistics endpoints]
**Learning:** Statistics endpoints that iterate over categories (like game types) to perform multiple database queries per category (e.g., count, max, average) create a significant performance bottleneck (N+1 query problem). This can be optimized using Prisma's `groupBy` and aggregate features (`_count`, `_max`, `_avg`) to fetch all required data in a single database roundtrip.
**Action:** Always check for loops containing database queries in controller logic. Prefer bulk data retrieval and in-memory mapping over sequential per-category queries.

## 2025-05-10 - Batching upserts in logMistakes
**Learning:** Sequential database roundtrips in a loop (O(n)) can be significantly optimized by aggregating data first and using Prisma transactions. Even when a native 'upsertMany' is missing, grouping by key and batching within a transaction reduces latency.
**Action:** Always look for loops containing database calls and consider if they can be aggregated or batched using `$transaction`.

## 2025-05-24 - Parallelizing bulk metric fetching
**Learning:** When refactoring N+1 queries into bulk fetches, use `Promise.all` to execute independent `count`, `aggregate`, and `findMany` queries in parallel. This minimizes the total response time to the duration of the slowest query rather than the sum of all queries.
**Action:** Always wrap independent bulk data retrieval queries in `Promise.all` when optimizing controllers.

## 2026-06-05 - Offloading statistics to the database
**Learning:** Performing statistical calculations (average, max, etc.) in-memory after fetching all records from the database is an anti-pattern that causes high memory usage and increased latency as the dataset grows. Prisma's `aggregate` and `count` features allow these calculations to be performed by the database engine, returning only the final results.
**Action:** Replace in-memory array operations like `.reduce`, `Math.max(...arr)`, and `.length` with Prisma's `aggregate` (`_avg`, `_max`, `_sum`) and `count` functions for any potentially large datasets.
